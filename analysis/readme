step to perform the analysis:

1. produce the daily data with:  producedailydata.py
   for all the days contained in corinne's code.

2. produce a selection of the days to keep for the analysis: selectdays.py
   - a first selection is done by keeping only months from november to march
   - we perform an iterative fit of the temperature until the rms of the baseline is smaller than ??
   - this gives a temperature dependance and allow to select a set of stable baselines
   - the fit values and error are in the files /tempfit/tempfit_"name".npy

3. perform the fit on the data: fitdata.py
   (The fit is performed only once (independently of the orientation) we simply take a window large enough.)
   - load the data
   - load the simulation for nominal orientation
   - fit the data in a window of ?? hours
   - writes fit results: results, error matrix and chi2
      

4. fit the sun bump and compute the system temperature with fitradio.py
   - corrects for the temperature dependence
   - fit with a gaussian
   - computes the error on each measurement
   - computes the weighted mean and error
